# Background


## Private party gun sales

&nbsp;

85% of the guns used in a crime that are recovered by the police were sold at least once through a private party transaction (Wintemute, Braga, and Kennedy 2010).

&nbsp;

>  There is a large and growing black market of guns that are being sold by people who are in the business of dealing and are doing it without a license; and therefore, they are not running background checks the way the law requires. And it is fueling violence.

Steven Dettelbach, ATF Director, 10 Apr 2024

## {.dark-slide}

> I’ve spent hours with families who’ve lost loved ones to gun violence. They all have the same message: ‘Do something.’ Today, my Administration is taking action to make sure fewer guns are sold without background checks.

President Biden, 10 Apr 2024

 
> Every year, thousands of unlicensed gun dealers sell tens of thousands of guns without a background check, including to buyers who would have failed one – domestic abusers, violent felons, and even children. This single gap in our federal background check system has caused unimaginable pain and suffering. Today, as the head of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, I am proud to say that all gun dealers must conduct background checks no matter where or how they sell.

Vice President Harris, 10 Apr 2024

## The policy: Redefinition of dealers



&nbsp;

> You will need a license if you are devoting time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business to **predominantly earn a profit** through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms... By contrast, if you make only occasional resales of firearms to enhance your personal collection or if you liquidate your personal collection (without restocking), you do not need to be licensed

        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#fff5e5", color = "#fff5e5"))
```

## The gun market

&nbsp;

If private individuals are "engaged in the business" of selling, they could...


1. Stop selling firearms
2. Obtain FFL to continue selling^[An FFL takes a minimum of two months to obtain]
3. Ignore change and continue selling firearms without a license

&nbsp;

::: {.center}
*Declines in private sales should increase background checks as buyers turn to FFLs*
:::

## Our focus

&nbsp;

:::: {.center}
*Fewer firearms sold without background checks may reduce gun violence*

::: {.fragment}

&nbsp;

*But any effect on violence will only occur through changes in legal gun markets*
:::

::: {.fragment}

&nbsp;

*So we're focusing on proximal mechanism: effects on __legal gun markets__*
:::

::::




## Research Questions {.dark-slide}

&nbsp;

As a result of the rule change...

::: {.incremental}

1. Did FFLs increase?
2. Did background checks increase? 
3. Did the volume of gun sales change?
   * Did private listings decline?
   * Did commercial listings increase?

# Research design


## Data

* **FFL lists** from ATF
   * Number of new licenses
* **NICS background checks** from FBI
   * Number of background checks for firearm purchases
* Firearm sale listings from **Armslist.com**
   * Number of new private listings

# FFLs and Background Checks

## Basic design

&nbsp;

**Treatment group:** 25 states without universal background checks as of May 20, 2024 and which did not receive injunctive relief

**Control group:** 21 states and DC with universal checks

&nbsp;

::: {.fragment}

**Estimand**: *The average effect of the policy change on the treated states*

:::

&nbsp;

::: {.fragment}
**Identifying Assumption:** *In the absence of the rule change, the average untreated potential outcomes for treated states and the control group would have followed parallel paths following treatment*
:::

## Two analyses

&nbsp;

**Difference-in-differences** (DiD)

* Classic TWFE estimator
* Single treatment effect coefficient: ATT across 12 month period



::: {.fragment text-align="left"}

**Event study**

* ATT in each month before and after rule change
* Can assess parallel trends; should be no lead effects
* Can see timing, e.g., delayed effect or anticipation

:::




## Treatment groups

```{r}
col_vec = c("Affected"= "#4d5d75", "Pre-Existing"= "#7eb7cc", "Injunction" = "#da9262")

ggplot(usa) +
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = status), color = "#333d4d", linewidth = 0.25) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = col_vec, name = NULL, labels = c("Affected" = "Treatment group", "Pre-Existing" = "Control group", "Injunction"="Omitted")) +
  coord_cartesian(ratio = 1.3) +
  theme_void(base_size = 16) +
  theme(legend.position = "inside",
        legend.position.inside = c(0.87, 0.15),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#fff5e5", color = "#fff5e5"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#fff5e5", color = "#fff5e5"))
```



## DiD: Poisson pseudo-MLE (PPML)

$$
y_{st} \sim Pois(\mathbb{E}[y_{st}]) \\
\mathbb{E}[y_{st}] = exp(\alpha + \beta D_{st} + \theta_s + \gamma_t)
$$

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

**Variables**

* $Y_{st}$: FFLs, checks, or sales
* $D_{st}$: Treatment indicator
* $s$: State
* $t$: Month-year

:::

::: {.column}

**Parameters**

* $\beta$: **Treatment effect**
* $\theta$: State fixed effect
* $\gamma$: Month-year fixed effect


:::

::::

::: {.aside}
Standard errors clustered at the state level
:::

## Event Study PPML 

$$
y_{st} \sim Pois(\mathbb{E}[y_{st}]) \\
\mathbb{E}[y_{st}] = exp\left(\alpha + \sum_{k=-12}^{12} \left(\beta_kD_{st}^k\right) + \theta_s + \gamma_t\right)
$$

Same as before except:

* $k$ indexes time from treatment
* $D_{sk}=1$ for $k\ge0$
* $\beta_k$ is effect for $k^{th}$ month after rule change
   * Pre-intervention: the average difference in the outcome between the control and treated states in each month
   * Post-intervention: the average treatment effect for each month

## Robustness tests

* Linear TWFE with inverse hyperbolic sine
* Rambachan & Roth (2023) *HonestDiD* parallel trends test
* ITT analysis including injunction states
* Anticipation: Extend time period to 12 months prior to Bipartisan Safer Communities act on June 22nd, 2022

# Discussion

## Why didn't it do anything?

&nbsp;

Candidate explanations:

::: {.incremental}

1. The nature of the rule change was ambiguous, leading some people to believe that **nothing had really changed**

2. The rule change had little deterrent effect because it was **minimally enforced**, perceived to be minimally enforced, or because sellers were unaware of the change

3. **Few were affected** by the rule change; i.e., few private sellers were actually redefined as being “engaged in the business” of dealing firearms to “predominantly earn a profit”. 

:::

:::: {.fragment}
::: {.center}
*So I went and looked at gun forums...*
:::
::::

## Nothing changed {.dark-slide .smaller}

&nbsp;

> **Nothing much has really changed.** Private sales are still allowed. I can still post up at a gun show or post a classified to sell off parts of my collection to fund new purchases. The rule doesn't close a loophole, it just creates (or really mostly restates) the existing rules about straw purchases and operating without a license. The rule was and remains that private sales don't require a background check. And the people regularly buying and selling guns for a profit, or otherwise acting as straw purchasers, were already breaking the law and continue to be breaking the law, and this rule doesn't seem to be creating new mechanisms for identifying and stopping those people. So really this seems like **a preservation of the status quo**... At best I think a bunch of government lawyers got paid to waste a bunch of ink on a rule that will serve as a **symbolic but ultimately meaningless gesture** to people who want to see politicians do something about gun laws, but don’t fundamentally understand gun laws.

## No enforcement

&nbsp;

Another common thread: the policy is DOA and will never be enforced

:::: {.fragment}

&nbsp;

::: {.center}

*To find out, we FOIAed the ATF for records on investigations and prosecutions for dealing without FFL as per 18 U.S.C. §922(a)(1)(A)*

:::

::::

&nbsp;

::: {.fragment}

So far no evidence changes:

* 25 cases per month May 2023 to April 2024
* 26 per month in first 7 months of policy

:::

## Few actually affected

&nbsp;

:::: {.center}

*Perhaps there are few unlicensed people selling "predominately to earn a profit"*

&nbsp;


::: {.fragment}

*Our analysis of online gun markets may be suggestive*

:::

::::

## Our conclusion {.dark-slide}

&nbsp;

> the loophole rule change originated in a 2022 bipartisan act of Congress that was spurred by a Covid-era surge in violence. Yet its impact appears negligible. Whether this failure stemmed from the deeply polarized politics of gun regulation, the toothlessness of ATF, or from targeting to narrow a group of sellers remains unclear. Consequently it seems unlikely that the rule change has had any meaningful impact on broader outcomes like firearm violence.
